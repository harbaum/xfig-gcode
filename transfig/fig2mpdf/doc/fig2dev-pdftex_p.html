<H1>latex/pdflatex driver for <B>fig2dev</B> for solving the overlaid
text problem</H1>

<p>As mentioned in the <a href="fig2mpdf.html">fig2mpdf page</a> there
are many pro's for using LaTeX for typesetting figures who are included
in LaTeX documents. Everything is working fine by using the pstex and
pstex_t driver family of <b>fig2dev</b> as shown in figure&nbsp;1 except the
case that there are overlaid texts in the figure.

<H2>Overlaid text problem</H2>

<P>If you want to have some text masked by
other elements of the figure e.g. to intimate some spatial relations you
can use different depths to get the desired result. But if you use the
pstex, pstex_t combination you will get bad results. Figure 1 depicts the
problem. All text of the figure is collected and processed by latex.
latex's result is put on top of all other elements of the figure
regardless it's original depth.</P>

<P>To get a correct result the figure has to be split into several
pieces concerning the occurance of text in the different layers of the
figure. Figure 2 presents a simple example. The at least three
different levels of text are  splitting the figure in at least three
subfigures which are to produce and to overlay. Therefore all these
subfigures have to have the same size because there would be no way to
get the offsets of the subfigures. I have created two new so called
graphics languages for <B>fig2dev</B>. To integrate the functionality into
<B>fig2dev</B> is the most effective way because <B>fig2dev</B> has all necessary
information for processing everything. In contrast to the <B>pstex</B>/<B>pstex_t</B>
solution we have to create more than two files containing the different
figure elements. </P>

<P>My filters <B>pdftex_p</B> and <B>pstex_p</B> are producing just two
files. The first one is the LaTeX file which contains all texts
separated in blocks concerning the used depths. The second one is a
shell script with which you can create all necessary graphics and size
files who are required for the subsequent <B>latex</B> run. The
separated graphics files are containing the figure elements under,
between and on top of texts. Because of the number of graphics files
isn't constant the names of these files is given as a filename
prefix.</P>

<H3>Known problems creating PDFs</H3>

<p>In contrast to the latex/dvips combination the size of the target
document has to be set in the latex file explicitly i.e. before the
pdflatex run is performed. Thatfore the <b>pdftex_p</b> driver
calculates the bounding box of all figure elements including the
special texts set by pdflatex. Here is the problem of the procedure.
<b>fig2dev</b> can not determine the right dimensions of the special
text included in the figure (imagine a formular can be much higher than
the height one normal text line). Normally this isn't a problem.
But if the resulting text is bigger than expected so that the text
crosses the calculated figure boundaries this becomes a promblem.
  </p>

<p>In that case you have to increase the size of the figure by
inserting one or some invisible figure elements. This can be done with
a rectangle which sourounds the entire figure for example. To get the
rectangle invisible you have to set the line width to zero. With this
trick the object is invisible even if you change the background color.
