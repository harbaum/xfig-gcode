transfig (1:3.2.1-11) unstable; urgency=low

      only seem to manifest problems with Sun's native Solaris cc.
    - Fixes problem where box appears in output
    - This fixes the difference between xfig and fig2dev splines
    - fig2dev should always write to stdout if no output file is given.
      This did not work for all output languages (Closes #24724).
    - Imakefile patch.

transfig (1:3.2.1-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Passes Lintian v0.9.4
     - Removed csh script, replaced with sh script because
       W: transfig: csh-considered-harmful usr/X11R6/bin/fig2ps2tex
  * Removed suggests: c-shell because no more csh code
  * Removed dh_link from debian/rules, (dh_link is from an unstable version of
    debhelper not avaliable in slink). It is no longer needed because of the
    removal of the csh version of the fig2psp2tex script. Thanks to Paul
    Slootman for spotting this one, and James Troop reminding me that dh_link is
    only in the unstable version of debhelper that appears in spud.
  * Fixed the missing DESTDIR in the install rule of fig2dev/Imakefile. Thanks
    goes to Paul again for spotting this one.
  * When installing the documentary, the it was assumed that fig2dev was
    installed, this has been fixed. This completes the fixing of Bug#30753. And
    a final thanks goes to Paul for spotting this one.
  * Removed debian/rules.old - it was a bit silly keeping it.
