  * Modified debian/xpm.xpm to follow menu policy about colors.

xfig (1:3.2.4-beta6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 3.2.4-beta6.
    - fixes the problem that having the NumLock key on prevents the
      accelerators from working (Closes: #148286).
    - The problem toolbar overlapping other buttons seems to be fixed now
      (Closes: #150019).
    - The "UPDATE object" function allows to update the depth of a compund
      now, where the smallest depth of the compound is set to the new
      value while all other depths are kept relatively to this smallest
      depth (Closes: #123413).
    - 3D look can be disabled now using "Fig*shadowWidth: 0" in
      $HOME/.Xresources (Closes: #132071).
    - Resizing the XFig window or using the -geometry option now works and
      adapts the buttons per row correctly (Closes: #53295).
    - Parsing a FIG file does not longer SEGV, when a spline consists of
      less then 3 points but prints out a warning and ignores that spline
      (Closes: #161657).
  * Apply upstream patch.colortiff, which calls "fig2dev -L tiff -C" with
    a dummy argument on -C, otherwise creating color previews in TIFF
    doesn't work.
  * Apply upstream patch.gridunits, which fixes the bug where xfig may
    change the Major/Minor grid tick values to "None" to 0.0.
  * Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.5.7:
    - New handling of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * Increase priority of xpdf over gv in xfig-pdf-viewer.
  * Add kghostview as a 5th alternative to xfig-pdf-viewer.
  * Add light(1) to xfig-www-browser and optimize priority of browsers.
  * Move the documentation (in package xfig-doc) from
    /usr/share/doc/xfig-doc to /usr/share/doc/xfig.
  * Moved xpm icons from /usr/X11R6/include/X11/pixmaps to
    /usr/share/pixmaps.

xfig (1:3.2.3.d-rel-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Suggests: netpbm, which is used to read GIF images (Closes: #146302).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Thu,  9 May 2002 01:15:59 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.d-rel-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * xfig-www-browser: add opera, increase priority of mozilla and galeon,
    which are now very usable browsers.
  * Apply patch by Daniel Robert Franklin <daniel@ieee.uow.edu.au>, which
    fixes segfaults on load/save when ~/.xfigrc has wrong permissions.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Mar 2002 10:39:49 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3.d-rel-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add debian/mime to handle application/x-xfig MIME type.
  * Remove dh_installxaw, which is no longer used or supported 
    (Closes: #120231).
  * Install new version of xfig-howto.pdf from
    http://www.ee.ryerson.ca/~phiscock/papers/xfig-howto.pdf, which uses
    Type1 fonts now (Closes: #102783).
  * XFIG.AND.LATEX, README.Debian: Add a comment that the transfig pstex
    driver needs \usepackage{color} (Closes: #77516).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun, 10 Feb 2002 17:05:11 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3.d-rel-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply upstream patch cluster against 3.2.3d:
    - patch.deletedepth: Do no longer erase depth counts when deleting a
      region of a figure.  Correctly handle depths of temporary objects
      when using library objects.
    - patch.editcompound: If you have >64 text objects in a compound,
      editing the compound no longer causes a segfault.
    - patch.imakefile: fixes the problem that several vendors' "make"
      don't like the blank line produced when I18N is not defined.
    - patch.joinsplit: If the user mistakenly clicked the *left* mouse
      button on a point where he wanted to *split* a line, the ability to
      split was turned off. 
    - patch.libsubs: fixes the bug where subdirectories without any .fig
      files appeared in the library menu. 
    - patch.pdftex: adds the "Combinded PDF/LaTeX" export option to xfig
      (Recommends transfig >= 1:3.2.3.d-rel-2, which is needed to use this
      new feature).
    - patch.pointermapping: make xfig automatically flip the mouse hints
      messages when pointer button 1 is not logical button 1.  This
      overrides the -flipvisualhints command-line argument to xfig. 
    - patch.readcompound2: makes xfig only recalculate the bounds of
      compound objects being read if there are no bounds following the "6"
      or they are all 0.  This fixes the problem introduced in 3.2.3d
      where objects that were bound at a certain point positioning are
      rebound at the current positioning. 
    - patch.showlengths: fixes the final problems with the "showlengths"
      lines and texts erasing parts of the objects below them.
    - patch.textattrib: If the user clicks on or modifies an existing
      text, and presses return, the new text on the next like will use the
      attributes of the first text instead of the attributes from the
      indicator panel. 
  * Stop calling "make install.man", which is broken with the given
    Imakefile (Closes: #115419).
  * Replace dh_installmanpages by dh_installman and install various man
    pages using it.
  * Remove C-33A-USAF-1.fig KC-33A-USAF-1.fig KC-33-RORO-M113A4.fig
    KC-33-RORO-M8AGS.fig KC-747+KMD-11.fig M113A1-Camo.fig M8-AGS-Camo.fig
    from examples directory, because they are not DFSG free (only for
    educational and non-commercial use) (Closes: #115658)

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Oct 2001 12:13:24 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.d-rel-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add mozilla as another alternative in xfig-www-browser (Closes: #104205).
  * Add "Fig*AllowShellResize: false" to Fig.ad to avoid problems with
    XFig window constantly resizing itself (Closes: #107209).
  * Added a new documentation PDFLATEX.AND.XFIG written by Josselin
    Mouette <jmouette@ens-lyon.fr> to the documentation (Closes: #100656).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Oct 2001 15:13:56 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.d-rel-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release 3.2.3d:
    - Adds cascade menu to support hierarchical libraries (Closes: #95648).
  * Remove dh_testversion from debian/rules (use Build-Dependencies
    instead).
  * Make /etc/X11/*app-defaults/Fig* conffiles.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Jun 2001 11:10:45 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.d-beta2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply patch.globalpopup, which fixes the problem where popping up the
    global settings panel, cancelling it then popping it up again
    segfaults (Closes: #96138).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Thu,  3 May 2001 19:03:08 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.d-beta2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Build-Depends: libpng2-dev (Closes: #94800, #95004).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 24 Apr 2001 18:07:05 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.d-beta2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream beta(!) version 3.2.3d-beta2.
  * Some minor adjustments to make lintian happy.
  * Upgrade to policy 3.5.2.
  * Remove dh_suidregister from debian/rules.
  * Depend on debhelper >=2.1.6 and remove nostrip handling, which is done
    by dh_strip now.
  * Correct version in Fig.ad.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 18 Apr 2001 21:03:13 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.c-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Undo app-defaults symlink removal hack, which is no longer needed with
    xlibs-dev (>= 4.0.1-11).  Change Build-Depends accordingly.
  * Apply several patches from upstream author:
    - patch.arccenter: a more robust algorithm for finding the center of
      an arc given three points on the radius.
      (And change variable names to make this patch usable).
    - patch.scalelinethick: Fixes the bug where scaling a compound object
      by dragging a corner to the other side of another corner would make
      a negative line thickness and arrow width & height.
    - patch.zoom: This fixes two bugs:
      1. If the figure is large enough, zoom-to-fit-canvas calculates a
	 zoom of 0.0 and an incorrect centering.
      2. If the figure is panned and a zoom to fit canvas is done, the
         rulers aren't updated.
    - patch.search: improves the searching of objects at higher zooms.
    - patch.editdepths: fixes the problem where the depth manager doesn't
      always update correctly when the depth of an object is changed in
      the popup edit panel.
  * Add xutils to Build-Depends, because we need xmkmf (Closes: #89837).
  * xaw3dg >=1.5-5 is no more a libXaw replacement but a separate
    library.  I (the Debian maintainer) decided to link against Xaw3d
    instead of Xaw, which means that this (Closes: #54923).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon, 19 Mar 2001 18:39:49 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3.c-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recompile with dpkg 1.7.2, because 1.7.1.1 erroneously created a
    dependency to xlib6 (the libc5 version of the X11 libraries) 
    (Closes: #77941).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sat, 25 Nov 2000 09:39:24 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3.c-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to XFree86 4.0.1:
    - Build-Depends: xlib6g-dev, xpm4g-dev => xlibs-dev
    - Move app-defaults files from
      /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/[locale/]app-defaults to
      /etc/X11/[locale/]app-defaults.
    - Remove symlink /usr/share/app-defaults -> ../../etc/X11/app-defaults
      (don't ask me, why imake creates it...)
  * Rename Japanese locale files from ja_JP.ujis to ja_JP.eucJP 
    (Closes: #77690).    

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Nov 2000 18:42:06 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3.c-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply two patches by upstream author:
    - If the user attempts to load a compress .fig file from a read-only
      filesystem (e.g. CD), xfig will now uncompress the file to the
      TMPDIR directory.
    - Empty lines in the ~/.xfigrc file were causing xfig to segfault
      (Closes: #75534).
  * Comment my_strdup() from f_util.c (it's already in w_rottext.c).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 25 Oct 2000 21:40:04 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.c-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 3.2.3c:
    - fixes problem with absolute path names in command line arguments
      (Closes: #75257).
  * s/canvasBackground/canvasbackground/ and
    s/canvasForeground/canvasforeground/ in all documentation, so it fits
    the program behavior (Closes: #69727).
  * Upgrade to new debhepler:
    - Change to DH_COMPAT=2.
  * Upgrade to Standards-Version 3.2.1:
    - Evaluate DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS for -g and strip.
    - Move binary and manpage from /usr/X11R6/* to /usr/*.
  * Add skipstone, galeon, dillo, konqueror, and links to xfig-www-browser
    and xfig-www-browser.1.
  * Apply several bugfix patches from upstream author:
    - patch.popups: Fixes the problem where, if you popup a dialog such as
      the export dialog, then you move xfig to another virtual desktop or
      workspace, the export dialog will popup in the previous space.  This
      patch will make them reposition relative to the current xfig
      position (but the problem with WMaker in #73651 still remains).
    - patch.create: Fixes the bug that when creating Fig objects, if
      malloc() fails, xfig attempts to reference memory using the
      resulting null pointer.
    - patch.maxdepth: Fixes the problem that objects at MAX_DEPTH (999)
      were sometimes unaccounted for, meaning they wouldn't be refreshed
      in some cases.
    - patch.pictures: Fixes the bug in sizing of imported pictures.  They
      were too small by the equivalent of one pixel in width and height.
      Also, calls to strdup() are replaced with calls to my_strdup().
    - patch.read: fixes two bugs:
      1. While reading a Fig file, if there is a bad object inside a
	 compound, xfig would discard the entire compound.
      2. If any object is incomplete, its storage wasn't freed in all
         cases before returning to the caller.
      3. Comments longer than 200 characters caused problems.  They may be
         unlimited in length now.
    - patch.showlength: cleans up the "show lengths" feature by making it
      draw the lines and text using the xor operator to draw/erase these
      temporary indicators.
    - patch.update: Updating objects didn't refresh the updated object
      correctly if the bounds changed.
  * s/userscale/user_scale/ and s/ulen/len/ in w_msgpanel.c, which seem to
    be a typos in patch.showlength.
  * w_rottext.c: export my_strdup, because it is also used by e_edit.c.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 10 Oct 2000 14:07:49 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.b-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 3.2.3b.
  * s/allownegcoords/allow_neg_coords/ in w_rules.c (upstream typo?)

xfig (1:3.2.3.a-6) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Add pmos.fig and nmos.fig by Min Xu <mxu@Horse.ece.wisc.edu> to
    Libraries/Electrical/Schematic.
  * Apply patch from Joseph Maher <maher@math.ucsb.edu> to reset copied
    pointer subspline->comments to NULL.
  * Apply patch.colors from upstream author, which fixes the following
    bugs:
    - This fixes the bug that user colors defined in the current session
      aren't saved with the figure.
    - Also the background color for the "locked" buttons weren't restored
      properly when the lock was turned off.
    - User colors in current figure would be lost if user previewed more
      than one file before cancelling file popup.
  * There are only some small bug fixes in this release, so it should go
    into frozen, too.  It doesn't close any bug reports, because the fixed
    bugs were reported to me personally instead of using the BTS.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 26 Apr 2000 21:32:06 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.a-5) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Apply Brian's second patch.updatelayers, which avoids more memory
    problems with many different layers and creating compounds from this.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Apr 2000 00:48:11 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.a-4) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Correct typo in xfig-www-browser: s|/dev/nul|/dev/null|
  * Apply Brian's patch.badobjects, which allows to read FIG files which
    contain "bad" objects (under special circumstances xfig writes those
    "bad" objects to the FIG file itself) (Closes: #61364).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Apr 2000 20:27:30 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.a-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes the problem where the depth buttons are updated after each
    object is added to the list when pasting or loading a Fig file (patch
    submitted by upstream maintainer).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 28 Mar 2000 00:34:12 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.3.a-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Conflicts with old transfig versions, so transfig should automatically
    be upgraded (Closes: #60163).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Mar 2000 13:58:20 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3.a-1) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.  This is a bugfix only release, so it should go
    into frozen.

xfig (1:3.2.3-rel-0-2) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed prototype of curve() in u_draw.c, which caused xfig to always
    segfault on PowerPC at startup.  Thanks to Alex Romosan
    <romosan@adonis.lbl.gov> for debugging and patching this problem
    (Closes: #48113).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Jan 2000 10:38:08 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3-rel-0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (munged the official 3.2.3 according to packaging
    manual section 5 to make it bigger than the betas) (Closes: #48028).
  * Explain the decision to always use Xaw3D in README.Debian (compare
    this with #54923).
  * Fix version number in main.c, otherwise xfig will complain about an
    outdated app-defaults file.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Jan 2000 11:52:39 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3-beta-3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version. This makes "none" the default background color
    (Closes: #53699, #53331). 
  * Update xfig.html according to xfig.man.
  * Correct order of fig2dev arguments when i18n support is activated.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Jan 2000 22:40:09 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3-beta-2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Extend white background export hack to work on PS, PDF and pstex, too
    (Fixes part 2 of #54540).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Sun,  9 Jan 2000 14:09:26 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3-beta-2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version.
  * Rebuild xfig.html from new man page.
  * Add another work around for filling white background (-g\#ffffff) to
    the eps export function.  Now you can export with background "none"
    (this works in the upstream source) without problems as well as with
    background "white" (this works with my patch).  Maybe we should simply
    make "none" the default background for EPS export, this would solve
    all problems.
  * Remove xfig-howto LaTeX sources from debian directory, because the new
    upstream package now comes with a good looking PS- and PDF version.
    Remove Build-Depends to tetex and transfig accordingly.
  * Change default export_margin (the border around figures on export)
    from 10 to 0 (this was the default in former versions).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Jan 2000 14:59:52 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3-beta-1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Recommend transfig >=1:3.2.3-beta-1, because xfig calls fig2dev with
    options, which weren't available in older versions.
  * When exporting to EPS with white background, don't use -g#ffffff
    option for fig2dev, because this creates EPS files, which fill
    everything before the figure with white color, when they are included
    in a (La)TeX file. This is reported in #53331, #53699, which was
    forwarded to the upstream author. The applied patch is an ugly hack,
    so I won't close this bug now, but it should work around the biggest
    problems.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 29 Dec 1999 21:17:53 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3-beta-1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * s/xpm6g-dev/xpm4g-dev/ in build-depends (Closes: #53196).
  * Add LaTeX sources of xfig-howto and create a new (smaller and much
    more readable) xfig-howto.pdf.
  * Add xfig-pdf-viewer and man page and use it to view PDF documentation
    instead of always calling gv.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 21 Dec 1999 19:11:11 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.3-beta-1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version (most of the former patches are incorporated now
    upstream).
  * Disable input tablet support, it is broken in 3.2.3-beta-1.
  * Depend on Xaw3d, this doesn't work with other Xaw replacements.
  * Remove xaw-wrapper support (no longer needed, because of Xaw3d
    dependency). Remove symlink to/from /etc/alternatives/xfig in preinst.
  * Suggest gsfonts-x11 (>= 0.7), which supports avantgarde aliases as
    used in u_fonts.c.
  * Add menu list to <noframes> tag of Doc/html/index.html, so the
    documentation can be read with browsers that doesn't support frames.
  * Create new xfig-howto.pdf from xfig-howto.ps by using ghostscript,
    because the xfig-howto.pdf from the source package cannot be displayed
    with gv.  Add source dependency to gs.
  * Added hints to menu file.
  * Added 32x32 pixel icon and use it in menu file.
  * xfig-www-browser: 
    - Use type instead of test -x to find out what programs are available.
    - Use x-terminal-emulator instead of xterm (with xterm, rxvt, eterm as
      fallback)
  * Upgrade to Standards version 3.1.1: Add Build-Depends.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Dec 1999 01:13:48 +0100

xfig (1:3.2.2-13) unstable; urgency=low

  * Remove images which are not referenced in HTML files from
    /usr/share/doc/xfig-doc/html/images.
  * Add a shell script xfig-www-browser, which automatically selects the
    best available HTML browser, to xfig-doc package.
  * Change control and Fig.ad accordingly.
  * Remove left over doc-base files with old xfig ID in xfig-doc.preinst.
  * Fix segfault in free_subspline(), which was introduced with the free
    spline patch.  Thanks to Brian V. Smith for this bug fix.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 12 Oct 1999 12:06:48 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.2-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upgrade to Debian Standards version 3.0.1
    - /usr/doc -> /usr/share/doc
  * remove debian/compress and debian/xfig-doc.compress (not needed)
  * Applied Korean support patch provided by Changwoo Ryu
    <cwryu@debian.org> (Closes: #45369).
  * Smart-links were lost when copying linked compounds.  Thanks to
    Olivier Delemar <delemar@mimosa.ceng.cea.fr> for reporting and
    providing the patch written by Brian Smith (Closes: #45822).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Thu, 23 Sep 1999 15:41:22 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.2-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected control file (the object library files are moved from
    xfig-doc to xfig since 1:3.2.2-2.1).
  * Changed copyright of HTML documentation with permission of the
    copyright holders (T.Sato and Brian V. Smith). Now the documentation
    is DFSG-free (Closes #39824).
  * Replaced all ``VEF00200@niftyserve.or.jp'' in the English version of
    the documentation to ``VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp'' on behalf of T.Sato.
  * Get rid of "incompatible pointer type" warnings in d_text.c.

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Tue, 22 Jun 1999 16:30:18 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added icons xfig.xpm and mini-xfig.xpm, where the latter one is used
    in the menu.
  * Converted from varargs.h to stdarg.h to be ANSI-C compliant. This
    allows us to recompile xfig on an Alpha Linux system. This recompiled
    version will close #32735.

xfig (1:3.2.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use kterm lynx instead of xterm lynx for viewing documentation in
    Japanese locale. xfig-doc now suggests xterm | kterm for this.
    Thanks to Taketoshi Sano <xlj06203@nifty.ne.jp>.
  * Merged T.Sato's <VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp> small screen patch and use
    large icons again (Closes #31148, #34798, #37520)
  * Fixed problem with inputStyle OverTheSpot (Patch from Sato Tomonori).

 -- Roland Rosenfeld <roland@debian.org>  Fri, 21 May 1999 16:40:46 +0200

xfig (1:3.2.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Suggest gs (>= 5.10-1) | gs-aladdin (>= 5.10-1), needed for eps
    import (Closes #12185).
  * Changed u_fonts.c to use original Adobe Postscript fonts. Suggest
    gsfonts-x11 to make ghostscript fonts available as X11 fonts (Closes
    #19073, #31380).
  * Merged patch for creating arcs with specific center point, diameter or
    angle written by T.Sato <VEF00200@nifty.ne.jp>.
  * Merged in patch collection from upstream author Brian V. Smith
    <xfigmail@epb1.lbl.gov>, which results in an unofficial xfig 3.2.2a,
    with the following patches:
    - Fixes arrowheads on arcs
    - Fix BadWindow error for the X_ClearArea when previewing a file and
      the canvas is redrawn 
    - Fixes problem where some servers won't draw dashed lines of 0 width
    - Add delete window catching. Some window managers use destroy window
      if delete window isn't honored.
    - Fixes bug where file name is clobbered because it writes
      uncompressed filename over original name, but the string space is in
      the Xt library. 
    - make xfig flip left/right text justification when flipping a
      compound object with text horizontally.
    - Solaris and DEC Unix don't like "inline" so we'll use "__inline"
    - fix the problem of zooming in on a figure that has *large*
      coordinates (140000 Fig units or > 16000 screen units).
      It also makes the point allocation for zXDrawLines and zXFillPolygon 
      more efficient by not allocing/freeing every time a polyline/gon is
      drawn.
    - Added minimal changes from paste/redraw bugfix (most of it was done
      in 1:3.2.2-7)
    - Fixes problem where the edit- and/or pen colors didn't show the
      color in the popup color panel for any non-PseudoColor visual.
    - fixes the potential problem of segfaults when freeing splines.
      A F_Spline ** should be passed, not F_spline *.
    - fixes the problem that xfig segfaults when it tries to display a 
      string with only blanks at 90 degrees using the adobe-courier font.
      The lbearing and rbearing are both zero in that case.
      The second part of the patch fixes the "markers" so that it only
      draws one for this case of zero-dimension string so that one marker
      doesn't undo the other.
    - fixes the problem when allocating too many user colors
    - fixes the bug when updating text to/from PostScript and LaTeX fonts
      using the update feature.
    - Merged Imakefile patch.
  * Did some Imakefile rewriting.

xfig (1:3.2.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Debian maintainer.
  * Added ja_JP.ujis app-defaults which enable -international (Closes #34799).
  * Made documentation also available with LANG=ja_JP.ujis.
  * Disable GIF writing routines in f_wrgif.c which are non-free. This is
    only used for screen capturing and PCX does this job as good as GIF
    did. No problem with exporting to GIF which is realized by calling
    ppmtogif. See README.Debian for more information.
  * No longer "hang" when pasting. Merged in patch from the upstream
    authors, thanks to Manfred Pflueger, who send me this patch. 
    (Closes #29346)
  * Merged in inofficial patch from bug report #34799.
  * Updated copyright file according to the upstream README.
  * Added xaw-wrapper entry for neXtaw, because some (not all) people have
    problems with xfig in combination with neXtaw (Closes #31811, #32472,
    #37536).

xfig (1:3.2.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Change xfig so it uses the smaller icons, should work better on 800x600
    and friends. (suggested by Matthew W. Lee <lee@physics.ucla.edu>).
    If this really bugs any one with larger screen drop me a line. It would be
    interesting to see if I can write some code to make it a X resource option.
  * Change doc_base so that dh_installdocs handles it.
  * Add xaw-wrappers support. xfig is now configured so that it will not use
    Xaw95. Strangly Xaw95 was already configured that way.
