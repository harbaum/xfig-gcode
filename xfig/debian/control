Description: Facility for Interactive Generation of figures under X11
 XFig is a menu-driven tool that allows the user to draw and manipulate objects
 interactively in an X window.  The resulting pictures can be saved, printed
 on postscript printers, or converted to a variety of other formats (e.g. to
 allow inclusion in LaTeX documents or web pages) using the transfig program.

 This package contains the xfig program itself.

 You should think about installing the transfig package to export the graphics
 to several common formats.  You should also think about installing xfig-doc,
 which contains the documentation and xfig-libs, which contains several clip
 art libraries.
